## FreeCodeCamp challengesðŸ”¥:
1. [Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication)

My solution:
```javaScript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
