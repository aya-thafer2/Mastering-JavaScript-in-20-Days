## JavaScript Principles  
When JavaScript code runs, it:

1. Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/ â€™executesâ€™ each line - known as the **thread of execution**
2. Saves â€˜dataâ€™ like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory. We can even save code (â€˜functionsâ€™)

### Execution context
Created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts (weâ€™ve already seen them!):
- Thread of execution
- Memory

### Call stack: 

It is a traditional way of storing information in a computer.
JavaScript keeps track of what function is currently running (whereâ€™s the thread of execution).

* Run a function - add to call stack.
* Finish running the function - JS removes it from call stack.
* Whatever is top of the call stack - thatâ€™s the function weâ€™re   currently running.

* We create a little mini program, a little sub-program, an execution context into which we go and compartmentalize any data we're storing while we're inside that function. *When we exit that function*, **all is deleted, besides whatever we return out**, and then run another function do the same.
* We keep track of the functions we're running and where our thread of execution is using our call stack:

## Functions & Callbacks 

We could generalize our function - So we pass in our specific instruction only when we run copyArrayAndManipulate!

```javaScript
function copyArrayAndManipulate(array, instructions) {
 const output = [];
 for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		 output.push(instructions(array[i]));
	}
 return output;
}
function multiplyBy2(input) { return input * 2; }
const result = copyArrayAndManipulate([1, 2,

/* If I want to add 2 or divide or subtract 3 ot any fanctionality I just write
the small faunction for it */
```
