## JavaScript Principles  
When JavaScript code runs, it:

1. Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/ â€™executesâ€™ each line - known as the **thread of execution**
2. Saves â€˜dataâ€™ like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory. We can even save code (â€˜functionsâ€™)

### Execution context
Created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts (weâ€™ve already seen them!):
- Thread of execution
- Memory
