## Advanced Scope 

### lexical scope 

The idea that a compiler is figuring out all the scopes ahead of time befor being executed. 

lex â†’ the first stage of parsing.


### lexical scope VS. dynamic scope 

* The scope of ***dynamic scope*** is determined based upon a conditions at runtime (where this function has been called).

* while ***lexical scope*** is determined at auther time.

```javaScript
const n = "Aya"

function f(){
    console.log(n);
}

function ff(){
    const n = " Hello";
    f();
}

ff();
// Aya => lexical
// Hello => dynamic
```


### Function Scoping 

> ### ðŸ“Œ Principle of least privilege / Principle of least exposure:
> You  should default to keep everything private and only exposing the minimal necessary.


### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

```javaScript
function f (){
    console.log("hello")
}
f()

// we can do
// also it may do not have name
(function  ff (){    // not a functon declertion
    console.log("hello")
})()
```

### Block Scoping 


> ### ðŸ’¡Note:
> Block(curly braces) are not scope until they have let or const inside them.

### Hoisting
- **Hoisting** is the process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope.
- Variable declarations are hoisted but not their assignments. They are accessible but have an initial value ofÂ `undefined`.
- Function declarations are also hoisted, allowing them to be called before they are defined.
- Hoisting does not apply to function expressions, arrow functions, or variables declared withÂ `let`Â orÂ `const`.

### let & hoisting 
Wa canâ€™t say that let dosnâ€™t have hoisting, insted itâ€™s kind of uninitioalized state
