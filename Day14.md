## Advanced Scope 

### lexical scope 

The idea that a compiler is figuring out all the scopes ahead of time befor being executed. 

lex â†’ the first stage of parsing.


### lexical scope VS. dynamic scope 

* The scope of ***dynamic scope*** is determined based upon a conditions at runtime (where this function has been called).

* while ***lexical scope*** is determined at auther time.

```javaScript
const n = "Aya"

function f(){
    console.log(n);
}

function ff(){
    const n = " Hello";
    f();
}

// Aya => lexical
// Hello => dynamic
```
