## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
**What is JS?**
* JS is a dynamic programming language used in websites so it's called "The programming language of the web". 
* It's used to make websites interactive.
* It's used to modify and interact with HTML.

**Where do we use JS?**
1. Browsers.
2. Servers like Node.js.
3. Embedded devices like IoT.
4. Some other languages like TypeScript that get translated to JS to run in web browsers.

**HTML vs CSS vs JS:**
We can describe those as: 
- HTML is the *Noun*.
- CSS is the *Adjective*.
- JS as the *Verb*

**Where do write JS?**
- The browser's JS Console.
- Text Editor.
- IDE like VS Code.
- Online playgrounds like CodePen and CodeSandbox.

**How do we get to JS Console in the web browser?**
1. Right-click anywhere on the web page.
2. Click on **inspect** which appears at the end of the list.
3. Click on **Console** tap then start coding!âœ¨

## DOM (Document Object Model) ðŸ§©ðŸ§¶ðŸ“„
The DOM represents the structured content of a web page as a tree-like data structure, where each element in the HTML document is represented as a node in the tree.
Using the DOM, JS can access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically. 

Here is an HTML document example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a DOM example.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
And here is the corresponding DOM tree:
```
Document
â””â”€â”€ html
    â”œâ”€â”€ head
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ title
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ "DOM Example"
    â””â”€â”€ body
        â”œâ”€â”€ h1
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ "Hello, World!"
        â””â”€â”€ p
            â””â”€â”€ "This is a DOM example."
```

### Finding Elements in a Web Page ðŸ”Ž:

* `document.title`: Represents the **Title of the page** - *appears in the browsers' tab*.
* `document.body`: Represents the HTML **Body element**. 
* `document.body.children`: Represents **All the elements within the body**.
* `document.getElementById("board")`: Returns **Specific element with specific id**.
* `document.querySelector("#board")`: Returns **Specific element with specific id** but by using the CSS selector.
* `document.getElementsByTagName("h1")`: Returns **All the elements with the same tag**.  
* `document.querySelectorAll("h1")`: Returns **All the elements with the same tag** but by using the CSS selector.
* `document.getElementsByClassName("player")`: Returns **All the elements with the same class**. 
* `document.querySelectorAll(".player")`: Returns **All the elements with the same class** but by using the CSS selector.
* `document.getElementsByClassName("player").length`: Returns **The nubmer of the elements that are returned**.
* `document.querySelectorAll(".player").length`:  Returns **The nubmer of the elements that are returned** but by using the CSS selector.
* `document.getElementById("p1-name").textContect`: Returns the **Text element** inside of the selected element.
